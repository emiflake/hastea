#+TITLE: Hastea web framework
#+DESCRIPTION: A tasty hasty framework

* Fun with Asterius
  The Elm Architecture is a wonderful means for creating web apps without worrying about runtime errors, Hastea is a TEA-inspered web framework using those principles ontop of Haskell compilation through Asterius
* Building
** Using Docker
   You can find an asterius docker image on [[https://hub.docker.com/r/terrorjack/asterius][docker hub]]
   using this, you can run the following command, which will compile the Main.hs to dist
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   ahc-link --input-hs Main.hs --bundle --browser --output-dir=$(DIST_DIR)
   #+END_SRC
** No other methods have been tried, unfortunately
* TODOs
** Development
*** Add `Cmd`
*** Add diffing on Virtual DOM
*** Test out different input methods
*** Benchmark
