#+TITLE: Hastea web framework
#+DESCRIPTION: A tasty hasty framework

* Fun with Asterius
  The Elm Architecture is a wonderful means for creating web apps without worrying about runtime errors, Hastea is a TEA-inspered web framework using those principles ontop of Haskell compilation through Asterius

* Building
** Using Docker
   You can find an asterius docker image on [[https://hub.docker.com/r/terrorjack/asterius][docker hub]]
   using this, you can run the following command, which will compile the Main.hs to dist
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   ahc-link --input-hs Main.hs --bundle --browser --output-dir=$(DIST_DIR)
   #+END_SRC
   Alternatively you can also try ~make docker-build~.

   Other methods have had no success as of yet.
* TODOs
** Development
  - Benchmark
  - Figure out build system
    - Create library instead of executable
    - Import library into a Main.hs, rather than just inline
    - Native nix build (blocked by asterius)
    - cabal-style build
